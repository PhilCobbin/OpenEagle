# OpenEagle


OpenEagle provides interfacing to Flightgear to create a synthetic view of the flight using a Garmin G5 EFIS,
and other instruments to display the flight at 10hz. The system also includes tools to make and use browser 
based moving maps from the FAA sectional "tif" files free to download. OpenEagle replaces NAV, and FIX 
databases in Flightgear with current FAA data. FAA Special rules airspace such as Class B,C, and D, and 
MOA's et al are displayed in the synthetic view using translucent boundaries in the scene. See the intro 
video sample of the special flight rule area over the Grand Canyon at https://sourceforge.net/projects/openeagle/
