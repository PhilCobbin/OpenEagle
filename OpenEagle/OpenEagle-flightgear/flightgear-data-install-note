So, initially you would either install flightgear via:
  sudo dnf install FlightGear
  sudo dnf install FlightGear-data
or, using gnome-software.

If using gnome-software you will find flightgear under the heading of games.
It is after all a flight simulator.

But, when installing using the above method(s) on a linux system the data files
will be typically installed at
  /usr/share/flightgear

This places the installed data in the root partition.  We want the data in the
home partition.

Thus, after you install flightgear and flightgear-data, you will want to copy the
contents of

  /usr/share/flightgear

to the THIS directory on your Desktop

After copying the data into OpenEagle-flightgear you will find there is a
very small subset of terrain data.  See the install note under the Masters 
directory for downloading and installing Objects and Terrain.
